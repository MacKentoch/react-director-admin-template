## Usage

### Prerequisite

> Ensure to have NodeJS v6.x MINIMUM.

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

or 

```bash
yarn install
```

### bundle dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### dev : hot reload mode

Development mode = best dev experience (*hot reload, redux devtools extension...*).

```bash
npm run start
```

> Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### bundle production mode

```bash
npm run prod
```

### run production

In `Development` ReactJS is `not optimized at all` (*you may even find the application to be slow*).

*ReactJS shows its real power and is `amazing fast` when bundled in `production`.*

*General case:*
```bash
npm run prod-server
```
> Then go to localhost:8081


## What's next?
- [ ] get rid of jQuery (*use of react-bootstrap only*)
- [ ] add react-bootstrap-table
- [ ] add redux-form
- [ ] add authentication examples
- [ ] tests
- [ ] optimize image import
